1. Make a suite that contains your tests from theme 9 + the tests from
meeting 10 (who have the class). Generate the report
2. Think of a test class from the pages suggested in theme 8
- Write at least 3 test functions in a class (as we did in class)
Use driver instead of driver (what do you want, how many test functions do you want,
freestyle to start thinking of some test scenarios yourself).
